# B05 Agent tools

Status: shipped, at the snapshot. Source: upstream.

The agent has Pi's default coding tools: read, write, edit, and bash. Codemode lets it run one script that composes tools and reads Ultimate's state. A browser tool lets it see and drive web pages, its own UI included.

## Where it lives

- `extensions/coding-tools/`: read, write, edit, and bash
- `extensions/codemode/`: the script sandbox
- `extensions/browser/`: screenshots and page control
- `extensions/parallel/`: web search and fetch
- `extensions/secrets/`: user-global secrets

## Decisions

- [D005](../decisions/D005-codemode-sandbox.md) Compose tools in a codemode sandbox

## Evidence

- `692ca8f` adds the local coding tools
